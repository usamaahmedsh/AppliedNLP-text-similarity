# Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:

1. load and work with word embeddings using the **gensim** library
1. calculate cosinse similarity between two sentences
2. apply word mover's distance to textual semantic similarity

# Setup your environment

First, carefully follow the *General Instructions for Programming Assignments*.

To install the libraries required for this assignment run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To download the **spaCy** English pipeline run:

    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
