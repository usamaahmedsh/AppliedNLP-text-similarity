    "# Semantic Textual Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work on the [Semantic Textual Similarity](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task1/) (STS) shared task organized within the 2017 editions of SemEval. The goal of the task is to measure the meaning similarity of sentence-pairs in English, Spanish and Arabic as well as cross-lingual pairings of English with sentences in Arabic, Spanish and Turkish. In particular, you will focus on solving STS for English sentence-pairs. The task involves producing real-valued similarity scores\n",
    "ranging from 0 for complete dissimilar sentences to 5 for completely equivalent sentences, as can be seen in the following examples:\n",

Specifically, you will use the following objects and functions:"
